I am a second year Ph.D student in Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Syracuse University. My research interests are federated learning, differential privacy and fairness for learning and decision problems. I am very fortunate to have Prof. [Ferdinando Fioretto](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~fferdinando3/) as my research advisor. 

I love to play soccer and badminton when I have free time. 



## Short bio


I went to Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam for my bachelor degree and Rutgers Univeristy, USA for my master. I spent two years working at Trusing Social a fintech comapany based in Vietnam as a data scientist.
