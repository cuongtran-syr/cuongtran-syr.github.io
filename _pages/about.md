I am a first year Ph.D student in Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Syracuse University. My research interests are federated learning, differential privacy and fairness in machine learning. I am very fortunate to have Prof. [Ferdinando Fioretto](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~fferdinando3/) as my research advisor.
