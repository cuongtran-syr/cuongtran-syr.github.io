I am a  PostDoc Research Associate at Department of  Computer Science, University of Virginia. My research interests is Responsible AI. In particular, I have investigated the interplay between privacy and fairness in learning and decision making problems under different settings of privacy/fairness, learning(semi-supervised/supervised), local/distributed.


I love to play soccer and badminton when I have free time. 



## Short bio


I went to Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam for my bachelor degree and Rutgers Univeristy, USA for my master. I spent wonderful time working in industry at Trusting Social and Amazon Alexa.
